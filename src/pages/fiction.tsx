          I've published a few short stories so far, mostly speculative fiction,
          and one of my life goals is to publish a novel.
          To me, programming and fiction writing are symbiotic creative hobbies -
          there are many parallels in the processes of planning a feature or story,
          writing code or narrative, receiving feedback, and revising.
